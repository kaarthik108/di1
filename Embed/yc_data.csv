India is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. 

Gold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.

Using automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. 

With 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity.

Gullak‚Äôs Founding team is the team which built BHIM UPI App(10Mn Downloads in 10 Days), this was launched by the PM of India.

Whether you‚Äôre in Antigua or Australia, Saipan or Sumatra, goods can take days or weeks to come by boat the cheap way. If you need pharmaceuticals, fresh produce, or electronics quickly, expect to pay 10x or 20x in shipping costs to have it flown. Electric aircraft could be a solution for lowering cost, but we‚Äôre stuck with small payloads and low range for many years to come. So for the hundreds of millions of people around the world in coastal or inter-island communities that could benefit the most, the electric aviation revolution just isn‚Äôt coming. Unless...

Without requiring FAA certification or integration into formal airspace, Seaflight‚Äôs simple uncrewed ""ground effect"" craft will enable high value, time-sensitive cargo to be flown overwater, point-to-point between coastal communities at 10x the speed of a ship, with triple the margin of conventional air freight, and almost double the range or payload of a conventional electric aircraft. Express air cargo continues to grow at double digit pace, it's time to deliver it in the most efficient way possible for cost and climate. 

*You won‚Äôt find impossible machines here*

1) We have prototype early flying hardware (at 20% scale) with autopilot for sustained low altitude flight, built and developed entirely in-house.
2) We‚Äôre actively working with the Coast Guard and branches of the armed forces to be able to safely test and develop our systems and operations in controlled ways, to reduce risk - but if the US moves slowly, we have an MoU for unrestricted testing in Europe. 
3) After that we‚Äôll partner with an existing logistics operation to fly initial routes that are not heavily trafficked by ships, to build up our reliability and safety before scaling to other markets.

The patent-pending ALT TEX fermentation technology creates a polyester alternative that works with the existing infrastructure to supply a sustainable, high performance and cost competitive polyester replacement to fashion brands, at scale. 

The product solves key problems for fashion brands, consumers, and the environment:

(1) Fashion brands: ALT TEX sells fabric to fashion brands, allowing them to differentiate via sustainable options (sustainable fashion growing 11% CAGR) and hit sustainability targets, without sacrificing performance or changing their current supply chain.

(2) Consumer: The ALT TEX fabric is projected to be half the price vs. other specialized sustainable alternatives (due to low-cost input and scalability), meaning greater accessibility.

(3) Environment: A single shirt produced with ALT TEX fabric can divert 1 kg of food waste from landfills, 9 kg of carbon emissions from the air, and 4 g of micro-plastics from our waterways.

Co-founders Myra and Avneet have worked together managing teams and projects for six years, with backgrounds in serial entrepreneurship, corporate sales at Fortune 500 companies, textile manufacturing and biochemistry.

In 2021, 79% of consumers worldwide reported already having at least one payment card saved with a service or being open to doing so.

Last year, the number of new payment cards issued was at an all-time high. For users, however, switching banks or opening a new card now comes with an additional hurdle: they need to update their payment info across the internet. On the other side of that equation, card issuers have no visibility or control over the card-on-file updating process, and as a result struggle to get their new users to switch their spend from their old card to the new one, leading to low conversion rates and missed revenue opportunities.

Tailor is the first YC company fully based in Japan.

**The Problem**

70% of the Japanese 100 billion software market is spent on customized development!

However, Japan is not alone when it comes to customizing the legacy ERP system in a large enterprise.

Legacy, monolithic systems make it very difficult to customize and hard to integrate. Every time the company wants to change something, it becomes a huge project.

On top of this, whether it‚Äôs from global or local vendors, most ERP users are frustrated with:

- Clunky and complicated UI
- Too many features that you‚Äôll never use
- Too less features that you actually need
- Poor 3rd party integration options
- No transparency / black box system
- Just super expensive

**The Solution**

Why Headless?

- With our headless product, the frontend is easy to customize for clients
- API-first approach makes it easy to connect with other existing systems or 3rd party services

What does it mean to our clients?

- Faster development
- Reduced maintenance cost
- Well-documented backend APIs

Tailor‚Äôs key capabilities:

- GraphQL endpoint for flexible frontend development
- Customizable data model templates to describe complex business logic of large enterprises
- Customizable workflows depending on the client's specific business process
- Directory service that can reflect complex organizational structure (e.g. matrix organization) to the workflow",S22,Active,"['API', 'B2B', 'SaaS', 'Developer Tools', 'Enterprise']","Tokyo, Japan",JP,2021,2,"['Yo Shibata', 'Misato Takahashi']",6,https://tailor.tech/,,

As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic.

Cisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3‚Äô end. This assures not only 3‚Äô homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3‚Äô end. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination. These are just a few examples of Cisterna‚Äôs powerful technologies being used to achieve our goal of 10x higher quality mRNA for therapeutic application.",S22,Active,"['Biotech', 'Nanotechnology', 'Therapeutics']","San Diego, CA",US,2022,1,['Hari Bhaskaran'],2,http://www.cisternabx.com,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/cisterna-biologics/

JumpWire is unique from solutions such as data vaults by installing inside our customers‚Äô own infrastructure and clouds. It is interoperable with existing applications and databases, which eliminates the need for large data migrations or code refactoring.

üî• Why do we build this? 

In Southeast Asia, the education system is competitive and exam-oriented. 

There is a huge demand for interventions (tutors, workbooks, and extra classes) to help students perform better in school. Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.

üë®‚Äçüè´ Who We Are

The three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. 

After we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.

We worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we‚Äôve had on them. 

We then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. 

üöÄ Present & Future

Currently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. 

So far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. 

We plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students.

All co-founders know each other since 2019 and met at a one-year AI fellowship. Since their time at the fellowship, they have felt frustrated creating their second brain while shifting between apps like Roam Research, and Obsidian. These applications were burdening them to do all three tasks of capturing, organizing, and retrieving, making the cost to value ratio of setting up the second brain really high. They decided to solve this and want to shift the burden of these steps on to software, making it easier for a user to build their second brain.

Almost half of the medical appointments in Latin America are missed because patients simply do not show up. This ranges from missing a regular dentist check to missing an expensive MRI scan. With increasing pressure to improve access to care in developing countries, optimizing communication and coordination with patients is a key task to achieve. This is a massive problem especially in places where most people don't know how to effectively use self-service mediums (or are too busy to use them).
 
We bootstrapped the company and we are profitable. As of August 2021 we have $97K in monthly revenue from 15 clients with a CMRG of 20% in the last year. We have 100% logo retention and we grow with our clients. We are currently coordinating over 600,000 medical appointments every month, just in Chile.

This problem represents a $3.5B market opportunity in Latin America only. Latin America has 650M people, each one having an average of 3 medical consultations per year. We charge for every time we effectively communicate with a patient. We plan to handle several coordination interactions with every patient for each consultation, which considers a roadmap of scheduling, confirming, booking, reimbursements, payments, among others.

We are a team mixing strong knowledge about the healthcare industry with deep technical skills. Felipe (CEO) is a former dentist that has led deep changes in healthcare payments in Chile. Mauricio (CTO) and Jorge (R&D), both PhD in Computer Science, led the creation of the most advanced Spanish Language Neural Network used daily by scientists and practitioners in LatAm (BETO: Spanish BERT).

In a weekend project, Mauricio and Jorge automated the communication with students attending a summer school obtaining impressive engagement. Felipe was struggling with contacting his patients to coordinate appointments, and saw a big opportunity in this technology.

Unlike Rent the Runway, we don‚Äôt handle any inventory or deal with cleaning the items. Our initial target market is sorority girls who can have up to 3-4 events per week that they need a new outfit/dress for. One of our core theses is that this idea couldn‚Äôt have existed at scale until now because resale apps like Depop & Poshmark paved the way for a P2P model to work after familiarizing users with the process of taking pictures of items, shipping, etc. 

Advantages to our P2P model

- Entrepreneur-led
    - Similar to Depop, most of our growth will be spearheaded by a group of ‚Äútop renters‚Äù
- More variety in inventory
    - Existing rental companies like Rent the Runway own all the inventory so they're limited to the brands they buy/partner with. Since we're P2P, our users can rent any item or brand that's in someone else's closet
- Better margins
    - we don‚Äôt touch any inventory or deal with the cleaning of any items
    - Unlike Rent the Runway, we don‚Äôt handle any inventory or the cleaning of items. This means people renting out their clothing on Dressd are responsible for shipping things out & returning them in good condition

1. Lightning Fast
We are on the mission to improve loading times for eCommerce users, especially on mobile devices. We want to make sure, that every site using Vue Storefront will load in under 2 seconds for all users across the globe. Currently, it is their weak spot:  
a) It takes, on average, 15.3 seconds to fully load a mobile page. 
b) 75% of mobile sites take longer than 10 seconds to load.  
c) 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. 

Loading times mean better User Experience and this leads to eCommerce users buying more, giving better conversion rates:  
a) Walmart found that for every 1 second improvement in page load time, conversions increased by 2%  
b) Increase of conversion % at each stage of Customer Buying Journey at eCommerce based on 0.1s improvement based on Google Research (https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of marketing/creativity/mobile-page-speed-data/) 

2. Fast Time To Value
Vue Storefront is the glue for headless commerce,  giving merchants the ability to connect with any eCommerce backend, any CMS or any other 3rd party service, as we provide those API‚Äôs by default in our cloud platform.  This is saving our clients thousands of development hours. 

Also, because of the Progressive Web App features that we provide, there is no need to build native iOS or Android apps - everything is available through the web. In combination with frontend components provided out of the box, it is possible to build a new eCommerce frontend within weeks, not months. 

3. Fast content adjustments  with any Headless CMS
Headless CMS is the only way to embrace omnichannel sales, and we know it. That is why the Enterprise version of Vue Storefront delivers the API-first setup of integrations with the best Headless CMSes out-of-the-box. 

It allows business users to edit the content & publish with no-code approach

4. Fast learning curve for developers  
We use the modern tech stack that is easily adaptable by the developer community, and what is better market proof than the popularity of our Open Source Project? We are currently 5th most popular eCommerce framework globally and the 1st Frontend eCommerce Framework globally!

22707,Wyndly,Life's better without allergies,"### What is Wyndly?

[Wyndly (YC W21)](https://www.wyndly.com) fixes allergies by training patients' bodies to ignore their allergy triggers. Frustrated allergy suffers come to us when they no longer want to deal with pills and sprays. We diagnose the patient‚Äôs unique allergy profile and create a personalized treatment plan to give the patient lifelong allergy relief. Specifically, Wyndly is increasing access to  sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for allergy care. For our patients, we're combining the convenience of telehealth and direct-to-consumer care with an exceptional patient experience that never loses the context of care.

Wyndly represents an opportunity to change allergy care forever. With 60 million Americans suffering from allergies today, and with this number doubling over the coming years, there's simply an incredible need for the convenient care Wyndly provides. 

You can read more about us in [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/wyndly-aims-to-bring-allergy-drops-to-the-masses/).

### The Wyndly Model 

At Wyndly, we believe that better connections lead to better care, and we‚Äôre committed to making both happen at every step of the patient journey. Our allergy practice allows our patients to work with expert providers to develop personalized treatment plans for long-term allergy relief using clinically proven therapies. From a patient‚Äôs initial consultation to their final treatment delivery, we want the Wyndly experience to be a breath of fresh air for allergy sufferers ‚Äì truly effective allergy relief, simply and efficiently delivered.

Once we've conquered allergies, we're transforming the care model for every chronic condition. While transactional care for purchasing pills has flourished in telehealth, no one has gone after chronic care. Patients with chronic conditions are shuffled between providers, insurance, and more -- and they never feel heard. These patients deserve better, and we're going to give it to them. Wyndly is starting with allergies, but we'll expand into asthma, sleep apnea, and other conditions in the near future.

### Our values

**Compassion**: We approach all our patients and partners with an open mind and a genuine desire to be of service.

**Focus**: We do a few things very well, and are always clear about our boundaries and direction of travel.

**Courage**: We embrace ambiguity and discomfort because we know that‚Äôs how we grow.

**Progress**: We make something better every single day.

*It boils down to empathy and forward momentum in everything we do.*

22196,"MedPiper Technologies, Inc",Enabling health insurers build + deliver cashless health offerings ,"MedPiper is on a mission to build modern healthcare infrastructure to deliver personalized care and improve health outcomes.

Our Philosophy:

1. Hyper-personalisation is the future.
2. User experience in healthcare is flawed.
3. Service providers (not just doctors) should care about health outcomes. 

We believe there are two kinds of industries that are ripe for disruption: the first is where there is an opportunity to reform, it's not user-friendly, and there is a distinct lack of trust. The second is where there are a lot of uneven profit margins being distributed, where a few companies are making a lot of money, they have high-profit margins and yet, customers are unhappy.

Healthcare in India, unfortunately, belongs to both of these buckets. And this is the reason why there are many new venture-funded companies trying to bring reform to this sector using various attack vectors.

There are three reasons why we feel healthcare in India is ripe for disruption:

1. Size: Over 200B is lost in income every year because of NCD-related loss in productivity.
2. Efficiency: The industry is inefficient and has built-in redundancies.
3. Experience: Other industries have become responsive and consumer-focused (Retail>E-Commerce) whereas healthcare has always lagged behind.

The way healthcare is being delivered is changing, with patients treated less often in hospitals and more as outpatients, while payers are moving towards a system that reimburses providers for helping reduce the cost of care overall.

At Medpiper, we are working with insurance companies to build a platform where end users can access healthcare goods and services and meaningfully connect with the local brick-and-mortar healthcare vendors by being a one-stop shop for everything from telehealth and diagnostics, chronic disease management to medical devices and actual drug supplies. Our aim is to improve long-term population health outcomes by providing personalized healthcare and a seamless user experience while at the same time maintaining quality and price transparency.",S20,Active,"['Health Insurance', 'Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Marketplace', 'B2B']","Bengaluru, India",IN,2020,2,"['Nitthin Chandran Nair', 'Pranay Suyash']",22,https://www.medpiper.com,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/medpiper,https://www.linkedin.com/company/28735812/

This results in providers spending $300 Billion a year to get paid, and ultimately collect less money than what they are owed.

CoreCare aggregates administrative patient data from all systems providers work with (EHR, Gov, Payer), standardizes it in our Enterprise Data Warehouse and creates a single net view of administrative patient data for the provider. Then we add workflow automations (according to client specifications) to eliminate the manual work providers are forced to do to get paid.

21811,Hypermile,Driver co-pilot to make trucking more efficient,"Hypermile is on a mission to improve trucking efficiency, sustainability and safety by developing an AI driver assistance system üöõ üåéüå±.

Today, fuel is the main cost component for logistics operators, accounting for >1/3 of all operating costs. Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions. 

In addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes. 

With this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. 

Our product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel: anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. 

The company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5M pre-seed round in May 2021 from Y Combinator, Greg Brockman (CTO of OpenAI), Luc Vincent (former Executive VP of Autonomous Driving at Lyft Level 5) and others. We‚Äôve received a number of R&D grants from Innovate UK, Department for Transport and Horizons 2020.

We offer online doctor‚Äôs visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors).

More than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street.

Healthcare providers in the US spend $280B a year -- 8% of their revenue -- on medical billing. It‚Äôs one of the largest inefficiencies in the American healthcare system. The incumbents in this fragmented space are service companies that throw armies of humans at the problem. Humans may be good at tackling the outrageous complexities of medical billing, but are expensive, slow, and error-prone. We‚Äôre charging less and getting providers paid more by using data science, modern workflow automation, and machine learning to rethink medical billing from the ground up.

Today, we charge 5% of the payments we process in exchange for handling everything relating to getting paid: translating doctor‚Äôs notes into billable codes, claim submission, appealing denied claims, collecting from patients, and providing sophisticated monitoring & analysis for all of it. This positions us extraordinarily well for our long-term vision of being a complete financial hub for healthcare providers: not only handling billing, but also using billing data to better underwrite loans and AR factoring.",W20,Active,[],San Francisco,US,2019,2,"['Nick Perry', 'Adam Reis']",20,https://www.joincandidhealth.com,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/candid-health/

13215,Fair Square,"Bringing delight, health, and financial security to people over 65","In 1935 the Social Security Act set the retirement age to 65. At the time, the average life expectancy of an American was 62. 

A lot has changed in the last 83 years. The average American now lives until 79. The people turning 65 today were 45 during the first dot-com boom. The fastest growing segment on Tik-Tok is seniors. It took 20 years, but the internet has finally arrived for seniors.

But most of the products that seniors use are distinctly ‚Äúpre-web‚Äù - they‚Äôre cumbersome and exploitative.

When seniors buy healthcare, they have to talk to an insurance agent over the phone. These agents are exactly what you‚Äôd expect - they don‚Äôt know much about health insurance and they push Mom and Dad into the plan they get the highest commission on.

When seniors look to for liquidity, reverse mortgage brokers take advantage of their financial illiteracy.

When seniors look for companionship, they find themselves isolated in the suburbs they originally moved to to raise a family.

We are acutely aware of these problems because we see our own parents experience them. 

Fair Square is fixing them. 

Fair Square‚Äôs goal is to be a company seniors trust. To advise them on health insurance and financial planning. To find them a book club or an Art History lecture at a local community college. To have the customer experience of a five-star hotel and the care and respect of a relative.

13219,Dropprint Genomics,The better way to run single cell genomics,"Who we are?
We write software that understands the activity of individual cells as opposed to all cells. This approach is novel because we are no longer looking at average signals and can be precise. It is like a police person trying to identify the speeding car, they won‚Äôt find it if they look at all the cars at once, rather they need to look at the speed of each individual car. This is the beauty of single cell genomics, we can now identify that speeding car.

Why now?
The biggest barrier for entry into the single cell genomics market are cost and data analysis. To that end, we have reduced the cost by 10-fold and built the computational infrastructure for scalability. Although single cell sequencing has only been around for about five years, we come from one of the top single cell genomics labs and were the first to process and analyze millions of immune cells. Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system.

Where are we and where are we going?
We have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics.

Volumetric is a recognized world leader in building living multicellular tissues, with a focus on replicating discrete functions of the human body for basic mechanistic biology, laboratory testing and screening, and drug development. Founded in 2018 by Bagrat Grigoryan and Jordan Miller as a spin-out from Rice University, the full potential of our work is to build whole human organ replacements for patients, made from their own cells.

Our Technology and Approach
We have invented a suite of breakthrough 3D bioprinting technologies, featured on the cover of Science, that can build human tissue with complex blood vessel networks. We are leveraging this technology in the short term to build patient-specific tissues for drug safety and efficacy testing. Patient cells are taken from a biopsy, added to our proprietary 3D printed tissues, and then drug compounds are injected through the blood vessel network to mimic actual drug delivery in humans. Our vision is that our technology will provide rigorous, reproducible, and predictive outcomes for patients, resulting in drastically improved outcomes for diseases like cancer. More broadly, we see the full potential of our mission as being able to produce functional tissue and organ replacements for diseased or damaged vital organs in the body such as the lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, and heart.

At Arpeggio, we‚Äôve developed a platform of biological and computational tools that make it possible to record changes in the epigenome over time and watch the results like a movie to see how drugs work.

12728,MyPetrolPump,On demand fuel delivery service in India,"Why did we pick this idea to work on? 
India is a country with 200 mln vehicles (about the same number as USA) but one third the number of gas stations(60K) as compare to USA(160K), The consequence of odd number of fuel stations is long queues of vehicles at the gas stations to fill up, heavily congested Indian roads make it worse. Opening of 100K new fuel stations is practically & economically impossible in urban localities due to rocketing high land prices. And that's how the idea of mobile refueling was conceptualized by founders. Literally ""bringing the gas stations to doorsteps"". The problem of buying fuel is much more alarming in large volume consumer segments such as Vehicle fleet users like schools, cab rentals, freight logistics operators , tours and travels operators, hospitals, hotels, real estate etc who burn huge amount of dead mileage & loss of productivity while sending all fleet vehicles to gas stations to fill up. Additionally, India has a unique problem of Electricity blackouts. Current avg. is less than 18 hours of a day of electricity in Indian metro cities, which causes more than 20 mln household and commercial buildings running on backup generators which require Diesel. They cant bring the generators to gas stations either therefore they buy Diesel in jerry cans or barrels and transport unsafely. Our solution is solving the desperate & daily need of Indian consumers along with convenience.

Do we have domain expertise in this area? 
Founder is ex veteran of Shell with 9 years of global experience, has complete understanding Oil marketing business.

How do you know people need what you're making? 
We have over 5000 registred large volume customers who are waiting to be served. With our limited number of refueling vehicles ,we could serve max 1200 customers currently. We got all these customers without spending a penny in marketing and promotion. Zero sales efforts.

Our first product is a small molecule therapeutic for stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine, of which there are no FDA approved treatments.

Our small molecule technology are atypical inhibitors of the dopamine transporter. Cocaine itself is an inhibitor of the same transporter. Directly reducing craving or positive reinforcement is a successful treatment strategy for addiction. Methadone or buprenorphine (Suboxone) are key examples of this for opioid use disorder. However, these types of medications can be addictive themselves. This has been a major hurdle for medication development for cocaine addiction and has led to many leaders in the addiction space to abandon the dopamine transporter as a target. At EncepHeal, we believe that the dopamine transporter should not be abandoned and instead focusing on fixing the abuse liability problem. Therefore with our partners at the National Institutes of Health, we have shown that these new, allosteric modulators at the dopamine transporter do not display addictive tendencies in animal models. They are also effective at curbing cocaine addiction. 

Our management team has two co-founders, Omeed Rahimi and Aaron Lazarus, as well as an experienced addiction pharmacologist as their research officer. The team has an advisory board with entrepreneurial and addiction drug development experience as well as expert partners at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a subset of the NIH, and Wake Forest.

I created Spero (sperofoods.co) because I wanted everyone to be able to eat clean dairy alternatives that actually taste good. So, I leveraged my background in engineering, chemistry, and art to develop Spero's patent-pending formulations and brand.
 
At Spero, we make dairy from seeds. 
 
Why seeds? Almonds/cashews (nuts), which comprise the majority of the dairy alternatives industry today, will never create cost comparable products with dairy because they are too expensive and they're hard to scale. They take too much time, space, water, and human labor. Seeds are 7-8x less expensive and grow 50-70x faster than nuts.
 
Spero owns exclusive rights to the technology needed to transform seeds into dairy alternatives. Not only does our pending-patent cover novel processing techniques for cheeses, but it‚Äôs comprehensive for all dairy alternatives, including milk, creamers, yogurt, and even eggs.
 
By using truly scalable ingredients and cutting-edge technology, Spero will be the first company to make plant-based dairy cheaper than traditional dairy products. Spero will be the first company to make dairy alternatives mainstream.

We provide‚Ä¶,"If it isn‚Äôt bad enough that smokers don‚Äôt realize the scientific facts about nicotine, most non-tobacco nicotine products are poorly designed and unappealing to use. The leading gum is sold like a pharmaceutical drug, with flavoring and packaging to match. Vapes provide a cumbersome, over-the-top experience ‚Äî with use as tightly restricted as cigarette smoking itself, but more juvenile, conspicuous, and highly addictive. People want, and deserve, a better way.

Therefore, we want to deliver nicotine users a superior experience, and at the same time give them a way to transition out of feeling dependent. In a better society, people wouldn‚Äôt carry around the sensation that they‚Äôre stuck with an involuntary habit. Our mission isn‚Äôt to encourage nicotine use among people who haven‚Äôt started. Unlike certain vapes or other products, ours isn‚Äôt the sort coveted by underage users on social media. Our mission is to alleviate the harm related to tobacco ‚Äî first and foremost, by switching people away from the most harmful products.

So, at Lucy, we take an evidence based view of nicotine. Nicotine‚Äôs pleasurable properties make it an inevitable part of modern society. Therefore, minimizing harm in all nicotine products is key, in addition to giving people products and strategies for cessation. We feel that, as 1,300 people are dying of tobacco related illnesses every day in the US, the most important and immediate step toward a better society is giving nicotine consumers products they enjoy using that will cause less harm.

Our first product is designed to appeal to smokers and encourage them to switch. And, looking ahead, we hope to secure approval in the future as a clinically proven smoking cessation aid, while continuing to participate in the FDA‚Äôs public hearings around how NRTs are best regulated. Our goals are simple: because harm reduction is a better strategy around nicotine delivery than abstinence or prohibition, we want to help improve public health ‚Äî and reduce its costs ‚Äî through a superior pure nicotine product.",W18,Active,"['E-commerce', 'Biotech', '3D Printed Foods']","Los Angeles, CA",US,2016,3,"['John Coogan', 'Samy Hamdouche', 'David Renteln']",7,https://lucy.co/,,

1665,Oncobox,Finding the right cancer drug for each patient. ,"Oncobox believes that many late-stage cancer patients are dying prematurely because doctors lack a data-driven tool to help them decide which drugs currently on the market would most effectively fight individual patients‚Äô specific cancers. That‚Äôs where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with various late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.

How does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock. They don‚Äôt always know which medication will be most effective for their patients. Because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can‚Äôt just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.

Oncobox Dx analyses tumor DNA, RNA, and molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.

We actively seek partners from pharma, hospitals/clinicians, payers, and genomic centers. Feel free to contact us at hello@oncobox.com.

First, we help food and mining companies cut both their heat costs *and* CO2 emissions by replacing gas-fired steam boilers with our proprietary high temperature heat pumps. Our heat pumps make up to 3x more heat with the same amount of electricity, even at up to 1000¬∞F.

Once the heat pump market is mature, we will address the seasonal energy storage market. Our storage units are based on the exact same proprietary engine we use for our heat pumps. They work with solar and wind, and replace lithium-ion batteries, fossil-fired power plants, CO2 capture and storage, and fuel procurement, with a cheaper, sustainable and more reliable alternative, which can be sited anywhere.

The first opportunity is a high-margin market worth 3% of worldwide CO2. The second is a much bigger market worth 30% of worldwide CO2. By the time all cars become electric, it will be even more.

Our key is we are building the first Stirling engine to reach 86% of the Carnot efficiency, compared to 64% for the state of the art. We do all that while significantly decreasing costs, and increasing reliability.

When we started Bountiful in 2015, the grape error rate for predicting production was 30 percent. Why? We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren‚Äôt giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.

We saw a problem we wanted to solve.

Today, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we‚Äôve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.

More recently, we‚Äôre working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.

827,Razorpay,India's leading financial platform for all things payments & banking‚Ä¶,"The journey of building the ecosystem from scratch started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder)  were working on a crowdfunding portal project for India, they soon realized that most of the online payment gateway solutions were extremely cumbersome to get started on, especially for startups and SMEs. The company was surprised to see that the simple process of accepting payments was not streamlined. So they went about building an ecosystem from scratch with a hyperfocus on making the lives of businesses simpler and that's how Razorpay was born. The company witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve - democratizing payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, the SMEs. Razorpay today powers online payments for 34 of the 42 startups in India that became unicorns in 2022. 

Razorpay enables payments and banking solutions for over 10Mn businesses, including the likes of Facebook, Airtel, Lenskart, Mirae Asset Capital markets, Indian Oil, National Pension Scheme, TataConsultancy Services, Swiggy, CRED, BookMyShow, Ola, Zomato, Swiggy, ICICI Prudential among others. The core premise of the vision and values that Razorpay was founded in 2014 is the same as the organization practices today. It is to make money movement simpler and easier. Razorpay is on the path of building the Central Nervous System of Digital India, the next-gen payments and banking infrastructure for Digital India. The company will continue building an ecosystem that will not just build intelligent products that will make the lives of businesses easy and efficient but also drive financial growth and innovation for small businesses. All this is being done, together, in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for doing business.

Razorpay‚Äôs valuation jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion in just 14 month in 2021 and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley‚Äôs largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company‚Äôs valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. Razorpay plans to further scale up its Business Banking Suite, RazorpayX, and again build new banking solutions in 2023 that will help businesses focus less on handling compliance, operations and more on growth.

This commitment to make lives simpler will continue at a much deeper level now, thanks to the opportunity to make acquisitions with like-minded companies.  In total, till date, Razorpay has made seven acquisitions over the course of time: 

Acquired Ezetap in 2022 - India‚Äôs leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India‚Äôs leading fintech startup that provides payments-linked loyalty solutions to payment networks, banks, and businesses, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A Recurring revenue platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions.  RazorpayX Payroll in 2019 - a Payroll and HR Management Software company, to solve for seamless automation of a business‚Äôs entire payroll process, and Thirdwatch in 2019 - an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven company specializing in big data and machine learning for real-time fraud prevention. 

Customer has always been at the core of all disruption that the company does, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions:

- This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay‚Äôs several Industry first innovation into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automating payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include:

- First to launch India‚Äôs Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ 
- Razorpay became India‚Äôs first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI
- Razorpay also became India‚Äôs largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India‚Äôs leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience. 
- Razorpay expanded health insurance policy to include LGBTQIA+ and Live-In Partners- This industry-first move made Razorpay the first Fintech unicorn in India to introduce a thoughtfully diverse and highly inclusive insurance policy for its team members. The new insurance policy, introduced recently, is applicable to all current team members of Razorpay.

Backpack is a peer-to-peer platform that connects travelers and shoppers to give people access to products across markets in all continents. 
Each backpacker, regardless of their role as a carrier or a shopper, follows a simple four-step process to either earn or save money from their backpacking experience.
Travelers share their travel information and specify what kind of items they want to carry. Then they wait to get a ""backpack request"" and ask their price. Finally, they confirm the deal, buy the items, deliver them and earn money. Shoppers on the other hand, search items from their favorite websites and fill out the item description. Then they give their location and find a traveler coming to their city. Finally they ""request backpack"" and confirm the deal. Within days they can get the product and save money.  

backpack is founded with a vision to provide every citizen of the world with a choice; the choice of buying organic, authentic, and cost effective products with minimum friction.
Whether the product is state-of-the-art consumer electronics, exotic pashmina from the south-east, or even medication that are rare in some parts of the world and not so rare in others - we promise ourselves to get those products to your doorsteps.

Nearly 3 out of 4 millennials would rather go to the dentist than listen to their bank. While it's possible that we just really love our oral hygiene, it's more likely that we don't trust or like our banks.

It's not hard to understand why. Big banks use big budgets and armies of salespeople and marketers to sell old-school products layered with fees and penalties. Their profits increase when we spend more, overuse debt, and make mistakes like overdrafting.

Big banks get away with this because banking is such a vital service. Everyday spending and saving decisions that begin at the checking account ultimately determine whether we'll lead a healthy and secure financial life.

What can be done? Bill Gates believes banks aren't necessary for banking. Millennials believe technology companies can make banking better. So let's build a better bank.

It is a fact of life that servers and applications go down causing IT outages. Today most of the IT incident response is manual, tedious and lengthy resulting in more downtime and losses for businesses. At the same it's very painful for a DevOps engineer to wake up at midnight and on weekends to deal with server and application alerts. 

Enter Neptune, which lets a DevOps engineer automate his incident response steps --Troubleshooting + Resolution + Documentation,  so that he/she can fix the incidents in minutes instead of hours. So it's a win-win deal : For businesses downtime is minimized, and for DevOps engineers they need not worry about a deluge of alerts and midnight wake up calls.

Big companies like Amazon, Facebook etc built sophisticated incident response tools to achieve high availability and resiliency. We have architected and built one such tool for AWS. Now Neptune is making one such tool available for everyone.

Auto-unlock means that only you can use your Coin 2.0 while Last Known Location helps you find your Coin 2.0 in case of loss or theft. Coin 2.0 is designed for use in the USA.

116,imgix,The platform for your visual media.,"Nobody should have to employ expensive imaging scientists and engineers for their business to get the most out of their visual media. This is where imgix has your back. imgix is a platform for managing, processing, rendering, optimizing, and delivering your existing visual assets so that you can meet the demands of your business and your team can stay focused on what they do best.

The business demands on web visual media can blindside even the most hyper-aware content teams and developers. Just to be competitive on the Internet, you need your images to be sized perfectly to every device, served in one of any of a half dozen web formats, optimized to the absolute best perceptual quality while maintaining pinpoint performance, and distributed to wherever your users are, anywhere in the world. And that is just the baseline. Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, ""fake news"", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability.

By working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images and videos will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies. Our platform is designed to ensure that your images are always working for your business and never against it.

Soon one app become four, and before we knew it we had lots of happy users and lots of great coverage by all sorts of people such The Telegraph, Wired, O'Reilly and MacFormat. Being a friendly bunch, we took the time to chat with the hundreds of you who said hello, and we found you all had the same problem: gyms were either too expensive, too daunting, too boring or too inconvenient. In other words, a lot of people needed another way to stay active.

And the more people we spoke to, the bigger this problem seemed to be - it was like almost no one was active enough! Big problems require big solutions, so after raising some money from the visionaries at 4iP we amassed a team of the best designers, artists, 3d animators and programmers with the single mission: to improve the fu of the world by making an app so damn good that everyone will want to stay active.

Fitfu allows you to:

* Track your motion

Using the accelerometer on your iPhone or iPod Touch, FitFu gives you feedback to help you keep going and reach your goals.

* Celebrate progress with friends

Friends are the key to sticking to your goals, so we've made FitFu social; whether you want to cheer them on, thank them for help or just compare your progress.

* Discover a new way to stay motivated

The more you and your friends are active, the higher your level and the higher your points. And points mean prizes; unlock new content as you progress.

* Stay active wherever, whenever

No more being tied to a games console or a gym, now you can stay active wherever you are - be that your bedroom, your office, a hotel room or in the cabin of your Mississippi boat. (Yes it happens!)
